# Understanding protein evolution by connecting phylogenetic trees to domain architecture

## Overview
Our workflow consists of the following steps:
1. *Open the command line terminal and install dependencies needed for the analyses*
1. *Locate input files*
1. *Perform multiple sequence alignment*
1. *Perform phylogenetic inference*
1. *Perform domain prediction*
1. *Inspect/Clean the files output from the above analyses*
1. *Open R-studio and load the provided R script*
1. *Edit the R-script in order to import your files*
1. *Run the R code to generate the tree figure*
